description: Keanu is an open source project that you can help build! 
             We have decided to open source Keanu at such an early stage in order to solicit user feedback and help guide the product to success.
             Whilst we will always welcome contributions, we would value your time more if it were spent applying Keanu to challenging problems and locating its strengths and weaknesses.
             Please create a Github Issue if you encounter any bugs or have a feature request.
